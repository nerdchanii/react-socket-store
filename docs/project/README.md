# Project Docs

`docs/project/` contains maintainer-only operations docs. These files are not
part of the public package contract.

## Current Set

- [branch-policy.md](./branch-policy.md): branch families, maintenance branches, and backport
  rules.
- [release-policy.md](./release-policy.md): release eligibility, adapter-specific release rules, and
  cross-repository order rules.
- [release-runbook.md](./release-runbook.md): the step-by-step release and publish flow.
- [templates/policy-template.md](./templates/policy-template.md): template for future policy docs.
- [templates/runbook-template.md](./templates/runbook-template.md): template for future runbooks.

## Rules

- Keep this folder limited to active maintainer operations.
- Put supported adapter behavior in `docs/public/`, `docs/agents/`, or the
  package root docs.
- Do not keep closeout notes, historical reconciliation docs, or one-off
  decision memos here.
